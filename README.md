##Introduction
This project was started out of pure interest in the field of stegonography. Furthermore, I wanted to improve my skills and learn new ones.

##Technologies
*C++ 17

##Launch
Launch .exe file

##Features
*Write: Modify the least significant bit in the red color chanel of each pixel to hide the bit stream of a message.
*Read: Read the least significant bit in the red color chanel of each pixel to get the bit stream of a message and thus the message itself.
